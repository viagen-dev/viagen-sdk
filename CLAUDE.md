After changes run tests and fix failures, run typechecks and triple check that you have added any new routes to the app/routes.ts file!

When you make route with loaders, actions and api routes - log helpful debugging messages! We need to know when things go wrong. 

Add tests to all API routes. Ask the user if they would like to add methods to the SDK package for CLI interaction or not.

Worth repeating -- make sure you have added new routes to the app/routes.ts file!
